# pine64-ubuntu-gui
This script will expand the rootfs partition to fill up the SD card and install a gui on Ubuntu in Pine A64

To run this script, type:

<code>sudo install-ubuntu-gui.sh</code>

and follow the instructions given.

Currently, the script is in beta, which means that there might be problems introduced after running the script. If there is problems and you are able to come out a fix for it, I will certainly welcome you to create a pull request in my repository.
